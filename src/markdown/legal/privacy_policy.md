Unfortunately it is in the nature of things that these explanations sound very technical, but we have tried to describe the most important things as simple and clear as possible.

## Automatic data storage

## TLS encryption with https

We use https to transmit data in a tap-proof manner on the Internet (data protection through technology design [Article 25 paragraph 1 DSGVO](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&from=DE&tid=211086599)). By using TLS (Transport Layer Security), an encryption protocol for secure data transmission on the Internet, we can ensure the protection of confidential data. You can recognize the use of this data transmission security by the small lock symbol in the top left corner of the browser and the use of the https scheme (instead of http) as part of our Internet address.

## Cookies

Our website uses HTTP cookies to store user-specific data. A cookie is a short data package that is exchanged between a web browser and a web server, but is completely meaningless to the web browser and only becomes important for the web application, e.g. an online shop, such as the content of a virtual shopping basket. There are two types of cookies: first-party cookies are created by our website and third-party cookies are created by other websites (such as Google Analytics).

Exemplary cookie data:

- Name: \_ga
- Expiry time: 2 years
- Use: Differentiation of website visitors
- Example value: GA1.2.1326744211.152211086599

There are three categories of cookies: cookies that are essential to ensure the basic functionality of the site, functional cookies to ensure the performance of the site, and targeted cookies to improve the user experience.

We use cookies to make our website more user-friendly. Some cookies remain stored on your terminal until you delete them. They enable us to recognize your browser on your next visit.

### Pseudonymisation

Our concern in the sense of the DSGVO is the improvement of our offer and our web appearance. Since the privacy of our users is important to us, the user data is pseudonymised. Data processing is carried out on the basis of the legal provisions of ยง 96 (3) TKG and Art. 6 EU-DSGVO (1) lit a (consent) and/or f (legitimate interest) of the DSGVO.

### Disabling data collection by Google Analytics

The **browser add-on to disable** Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, dc.js) helps website visitors prevent Google Analytics from using their information.

You can prevent Google from collecting the data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website and Google from processing this data by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under the following link: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en

## Google Analytics add-on for data processing

We have concluded a direct customer contract with Google for the use of Google Analytics by accepting the &quot;add-on for data processing&quot; in Google Analytics.

You can find out more about the Google Analytics data processing add-on here:
https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3379636?hl=en&amp;utm_id=ad

## Google Analytics IP anonymization

We have implemented the IP address anonymization of Google Analytics on this website. This feature was developed by Google to enable this website to comply with applicable data protection laws and local data protection authorities&#39; recommendations when they prohibit the storage of your full IP address. IP anonymization or masking takes place as soon as the IP addresses arrive in the Google Analytics data collection network and before the data is stored
or processed.

More information about IP anonymization can be found at https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en.

## Google Analytics reports on demographics and interests

We&#39;ve turned on advertising reporting in Google Analytics. The reports on demographic characteristics and interests include information on age, gender and interests. This enables us to get a better picture of our users without being able to assign this data to individual persons.

You can learn more about the advertising functions at https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3450482?hl=en_AT&amp;utm_id=ad.

You can stop using the activities and information in your Google Account under &quot;Advertising preferences&quot; on https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated by checking the box.

## Google reCAPTCHA Privacy Policy

We use Google reCAPTCHA of the company Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA) to prevent spam.

The legal basis for its use is Article 6 (1) f (lawfulness of processing), as there is a legitimate interest to protect this website from bots and spam.

reCAPTCHA is a free service that protects websites from spam and abuse. It uses advanced risk analysis techniques to keep people and bots apart. With the new API, a significant number of your valid human users will pass the reCAPTCHA challenge without having to solve a CAPTCHA. We use reCAPTCHA to secure forms.

By using reCAPTCHA, data is transmitted to Google which uses Google to determine whether the visitor is a human being or a (spam) bot. You can find out which data is collected by Google and what this data is used for at https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-AT.
You can read the Terms of Use for Google services and products at https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en-AT.

## LinkedIn Privacy Policy

On our website we use functions of the social media network LinkedIn of the company LinkedIn Corporation, 2029 Stierlin Court, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.

By accessing pages that use such functions, data (IP address, browser data, date and time, cookies) will be transmitted to LinkedIn, stored and evaluated.

If you have a LinkedIn account and are logged in, this information will be associated with your personal account and the information stored in it.

The privacy policy about what information LinkedIn collects and how they use it can be found at https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy.

# Here’s how our technology works

Senzoro’s machine learning algorithm taps into the sensors of regular smartphones in order to calculate the current status of the machine

The setup process is easy and completely wireless: Smartphones are simply placed on top of each machine. Senzoro assigns unique tracking IDs (per machine) to link each machine to a dashboard.

Once activated, our app starts to read sensor values (e.g. accelerometer, microphone, gyroscope) up to 100 times per second. With the sensor data at hand, our “feature extraction algorithm” decomposes the signals into relevant (statistical) information. Based on this information, our machine learning algorithm classifies the machine status into either on or off.

This process is repeated many times per second. Extremely fast and efficient algorithms running on the smartphones are at the center of our highly accurate algorithms.

## Here’s how we set things up

We deploy a team to set everything up at your factory. Production can continue as normal.

We can track as many machines as you want, but we typically start with the most important ones. Our experts will place the smartphones on the machines and activate the app, all while normal production continues.

Seconds later, you can already watch the machine status in the dashboard. This procedure is repeated until all relevant machines have been equipped. From now on, you can see up- and downtimes of your machines remotely from anywhere in the world. If requested, our team will show you how to customize the dashboard to your needs. Adding and removing machines from the tracking process is very easy and can be done without our experts.
